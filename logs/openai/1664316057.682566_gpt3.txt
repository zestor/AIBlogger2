As artificial intelligence (AI) technology advances, so do the safety concerns associated with its use. AI technology is now being used in a variety of settings, from self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, and there are a growing number of instances in which AI-enabled systems have caused harm or raised safety concerns. One of the most well-known examples of AI-related safety concerns is the case of the Google self-driving car that struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018. While the incident was the first known fatality involving a self-driving car, it highlights the potential risks associated with the technology. There are a number of other safety concerns that have been raised in relation to AI-enabled systems. These include the potential for bias in AI-based decision-making, the possibility of cyber attacks on AI-based systems, and the potential for AI-enabled systems to be used for malicious purposes. As AI technology continues to evolve and be used in more and more settings, it is important to be aware of the safety concerns associated with its use.
